BareBones is an interpreter for the "Bare Bones" programming language
defined in Chapter 11 of _Computer Science: An Overview_, 9th Edition,
by J. Glenn Brookshear.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bare Bones Language:

Comments

    In this implementation, a '#' character introduces a comment, which
    continues to the end of the source line.

Reserved words:

    The words in the following list are reserved, and may not be used as
    identifiers:

        clear
        copy
        decr
        do
        end
        incr
        init
        not
        to
        while

    Reserved words are case-insensitive.

Identifiers:

    Identifiers must begin with an alphabetic character, and may
    contain alphabetic, numeric, and underscore characters.  Identifiers
    are case-insensitive, thus "FOO", "Foo", and "foo" are the same
    identifier.  Reserved words my not be used as identifiers.

Variables:

    In Bare Bones, variables are named by an identifier and may contain
    any arbitrarily large non-negative integer values.  This
    implementation is currently limited to the size of the host
    C compiler's uintmax_t type, which typically is 2^64-1.

I/O:

    Bare Bones does not provide any I/O facilities.  Input may be
    accomplished by initializing variables before program execution
    using either command-line options or an initialization section,
    or by using the "clear" and "incr" statements in the program.

    Output consists of the state of variables when the program halts.
    This implementation will print the variable names and contents
    to standard output.

Statements:

    clear <var>;            # Set the variable to zero.

    incr <var>;             # Increment the value of the variable.

    decr <var>;             # Decrement the value of the variable,
                            # except that if the value was already zero,
                            # it remains zero.

    while <var> not 0 do;   # Loop while the variable's value is not zero.
      <statements>          # may contain one or more statements, including
    end;                    # nested while loops.  If the statements do not
                            # alter the value of the loop variable, the loop
                            # will never terminate.

    copy <var> to <var>;    # Copy one variable to another, preserving
                            # value of original.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Language extensions:

One extension is added to the language as defined in the book.
At the beginning of a Bare Bones source file, prior to the program
proper, there may be an initialization section, in which variables may
be initialized to non-negative integer values:

	init X = 37;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:

BareBones should be invoked from the command line with the name of
the source file given as an argument:

	barebones prog1.bb

Optionally, additional command line arguments may be used to initialize
variables:

	barebones X=37 Y=116 prog1.bb

By default, variables that are not initialized explicitly will be
implicitly initialized to zero.  If the "-u" option is given on the
command line, this initialization is suppressed, and any reference to
an uninitialized variable, other than in a clear statement, will result
in a run time error.

Before the program is interpreted, the initial values of all variables
will be printed to standard output.  After successful completion of
the interpreter, the final values will be printed.

The "-O" command line option enables optimization of the program.
Currently only one type of optimization is performed.  A common idiom in
Bare Bones programs is to use a while loop to add one variable to another,
clearing the first in the process.  The optimizer will recognize this
idiom and implement a direct solution, replacing the standard iterative
interpretation of the while loop.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bare Bones Sample Programs:

Two sample Bare Bones programs are provided in the "examples" subdirectory.
fibonacci.bb will compute the Nth number in the Fibonacci sequences.
factorial.bb will compute the factorial of a (small) positive integer.

For example, to compute six factorial:

	barebones N=6 examples/factorial.bb
